# Weekly Reflection

### Weeks 2-3 (9/2 - 9/13)
With this being the last project for before graduation, I really want to choose something different that what was 
built in previous semesters. My instructor suggested https://rapidapi.com/hub and finally i found some inspiration! We 
will be exploring the use of API's this semester so choosing to combine the use of sports and AI options for my project
was a no-brainer! Using sports and A.I., i want to predict the outcome of a game!  Belieive it or not, that was my 
biggest struggle and set me back a bit but i'm excited to move on now. I worry that the scope is a little more than
i expected and hope i'm not in over my head with the given timeframe and my skill level.

Completed - (4 hours)
 * Choose project idea
 * Create repo
 * Tomcat configured
 * Favorite the API's i'd like to use from https://rapidapi.com/hub and other sites like it
 * Name, repo link, and project topic added to student directory

### Week 4 (9/16)
Played a bit of catch up this week with the project and course work. Our first checkpoint is due this week so 
that will be my priority before looking into this week's topic. After my project plan was done, i really wanted to get
the index page and some other placeholder's started and pick one of the easier user stories to start with. Ended up 
choosing Bootsrap as the framework for my project since that is what i'm most familiar with. Imported a theme from
w3schools.com from last semester that i liked as well. I struggled a little with the project plan trying to predict
what i'd be working but i had to keep in mind things change so it does not have to perfect.

Completed - 3 hours
 * Project Plan 
 * MVP user stories
 * README.md updated
 * Imported Bootstrap
 * Index.jsp page started
 * Theme included 
 * Renamed Repo

### Week 5 (9/23) Hibernate
Mainly focused on getting this week's finished and watching the videos. Not quite to the point where I want to start
putting this in my personal project, but I now have at least two working examples to compare with when the time comes. 
Having a good understanding on how hibernate functions with the annotations/relationships will make my life so much 
easier when it comes time to populate my tables with data. More importantly, the unit testing and ensuring things go 
smoothly is what I mainly want to pay attention to. Creating the generic dao to eliminate duplicate code was pretty 
slick also!

## Week 6 (9/30) AWS Elastic Beanstalk
This week we worked with Elastic beanstalk and RDS. Configuring our application and database to be deployed through
AWS. I feel like this will be more of something i would do towards the end of my project, so I will revisit this later.

completed - 1 hour
* ApplicationStartup
* PropertiesLoader interface imported
* GenericDao imported
* SessionFactoryProvider imported

## Week 7 (10/7) AWS Cognito
Finally felt comfortable enough to begin adding some of the new material into my project this week which also prepares
me for checkpoint #2. First I built my 6 entities needed to represent each table in my database then added the proper 
annotations configured through hibernate (Relationships included). Although it was tedious at first, everything came
out as expected except I may have been testing in my main database vs a test database so i will need to correct that.
I went ahead and added Cognito into my application while it was still fresh and the topic for this week. I'll be using 
the email used for each user during sign up to be stored into the database for later use with their favorite teams.

Completed - 7 hours
* Hibernate imported and configured
* log4J imported and configured
* Cognito imported and configured
* Database created with relationships
* 6 entities (POJO) built with annotations
* Database file imported and configured
* Unit Testing for Sport finished??? (CRUD)
* Checkpoint #2 complete

## Week 8 (10/14)
